Savor is a web application, or a meal-planning platform that takes in filters such as family size, dietary preferences, and budget, to formulate a grocery list that plans oneâ€™s weekly meal plan. It maximizes each ingredient purchased by the consumer by using increments of each item purchased in multiple recipes.

Backend: Firebase
* Built-in OAuth for Google Authentication
* Database: NoSQL
    * User information: Budget, family size, dietary preferences
    * Recipes: dietary restrictions, estimated price, ingredients, etc.
